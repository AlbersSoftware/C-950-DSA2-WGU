# About This Project
 In this project there are 40 
packages to be delivered on 3 
trucks. The packages and trucks 
have constraints such as delays, 
deadlines and wrong addresses 
fixed along the route. The program 
allows you to view the final results 
(how long each truck took before 
returning to hub + miles driven + 
package time stamps). Also given a 
specific time during the route to see 
packages status. Other features 
include look up an individual 
package by ID# after a given time, 
creating a hash table from scratch 
with open addressing for collision 
resolution, and time and space 
complexity analysis of each 
method. The heuristic approach I 
chose was the nearest neighbor 
algorithm, but I modified it to create 
a priority queue in order to meet all 
the package deadlines.
